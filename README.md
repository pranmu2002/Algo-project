This C++ program is a simple console-based application for managing and tracking orders in a restaurant named "Sangita Restaurant." Users can input the quantity of various items available in the restaurant, such as rooms, pasta, burger, noodles, shake, and chicken. The program then allows customers to place orders for these items, and it keeps track of the quantity sold and the total revenue generated for each item.
